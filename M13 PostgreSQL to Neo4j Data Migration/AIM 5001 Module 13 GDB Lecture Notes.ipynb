    "- Store information as __nodes__ (i.e., entities) and __edges__ (i.e., relationships).  Every __node__ and __edge__ is assigned a unique identifier. See a simple example: https://towardsdatascience.com/graph-databases-whats-the-big-deal-ec310b1bc0ed#:~:text=Based%20upon%20the%20concept%20of,that%20expresses%20key%20value%20pairs\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- In a graph database, we can define one or more __edges__ (a.k.a., __relationships__) between nodes. Within a graph-based data storage scheme, __nodes__ that are connected by __edges__ will physically \"point\" to one another, thereby enabling fast searches for information via related nodes.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- __Nodes__ contain __properties__, which are the attributes of the information stored by a given __node__. __Properties__ are typically comprised of __key:value__ pairs. Multiple __properties__ can be contained within a single __node__.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- __Nodes__ can be assigned one or more __labels__. Within a graph database, __labels__ allow us to group similar __nodes__ together during our graph searches. In other words, we can think of __labels__ as a tool we can use for purposes of grouping similar nodes together as \"sets\".\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- One effective way to contemplate graph databases is to consider each __node__ as __a noun__, while __edges__ represent __verbs or actions that connect to nouns to one another__. Each node within a graph database is represented by a unique identifier as well as one or more __properties__ that pertain to the person, place, or thing represented by the node. Each __edge__ within a graph database is also represented by a unique identifier and can contain one or more properties that describe the direction and characteristics of a relationship between two nodes.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- Since __nodes__ can have one or more __relationships__ (a.k.a. \"__edges__\") defined between them, graph databases are referred to as being __\"Multidimensional\"__ databases.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- For an overview of basic graph database terminology and concepts, see this link: https://neo4j.com/docs/getting-started/current/graphdb-concepts/#graphdb-labels\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- Graph database __performance tends to be very high__ since relationships between nodes do not need to be calculated at the time of a query (as is the case in a relational database). __Performance tends to remain relatively constant as the volume of information stored within a graph database increases__: query execution time is proportional only to the size of the part of the graph traversed to satisfy the query, rather than the overall size of the graph.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- Graphs are __naturally additive__, meaning we can add new kinds of relationships, new nodes, new properties, and new subgraphs to an existing graph structure without disturbing existing queries and application functionality.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- Graph databases are often used for __fraud detection__, __recommendations systems__, __social networks, logistics__, and __spatial data__, but usage is currently expanding to many other fields as well. \n",

    "# Graph Databases vs. Relational Databases\n",
    "\n",
    "- Relational databases can provide a high degree of data integrity if organized correctly. Tables represent __entities__; Each table can contain one or more __attributes__; __Relationships__ between tables are formed via both explicit __primary key__ and __foreign key__ relationships and the use of shared unique data values across two or more tables.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- By contrast, in a graph database we instatiate __relationships__ between __nodes__ via __edges__ that provide us with direct access to the __properties__ contained within edge-connected __nodes__.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- In relational databases, __joins__ are computed at query time by matching primary keys, foreign keys, and/or other shared unique data values of all rows within the tables to be joined. These operations are computational expensive and their execution time grows exponentially as the volume of data contained within the tables increases.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- To improve the performance of relational database __join__ statements, it is often necessary to __de-normalize__ the data to some extent, the effect of which is to diminish the overall integrity of the relational data model.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- In graph databases, each __node__ in the model explicitly contains a list of relationship records (a.k.a., __edges__) that represent the node's relationships to other nodes. These relationship records are __organized by type and direction__ and may hold additional attributes. When we run the equivalent of a JOIN operation within a graph database, the graph database uses these pre-built lists to __directly access__ connected __nodes__, thereby and eliminating the need for expensive search-and-match computations.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- As a result of eliminating the need for expensive search-and-match computations (i.e., the type of computations required within a relational database model), __graph database performance can be several orders of magnitude more efficient than that of a relational database__ when performing join-intensive queries.\n",

    "### Data Modeling Differences\n",
    "\n",
    "An easy-to-follow example of the differences between a fully normalized RDBMS data model and a graph database model for the same data can be seen here: https://neo4j.com/developer/graph-db-vs-rdbms/\n",
    "Note how within the RDBMS model a total of three tables must be searched and joined to identify all departments to which a person has been assigned, whereas within the graph model the needed information can be accessed directly from the node associated with the desired person. In effect, we've eliminated the need for any join operation since the department information is accessible __directly__ from the \"person\" node.\n",

    "\n",
    "- Graph databases are not required to follow any pre-defined schema; We can add, delete, and modify __nodes__ and __relationships__ freely at any time and for any reason.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- Start by deciding upon whether you should model a given aspect of your data as a __node__ (i.e., one or more key:value pairs) or an __edge__ (i.e., a __relationship__ that exists between two nodes).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- Each __node__ within a graph model can contain one or more __properties__ that are defined as __key:value__ pairs, i.e., __nodes__ are somewhat analogous to RDBMS __table rows__, in that each row within an RDBMS table row contains one or more __attributes__, with each attribute sharing an common attribute name. Within a graph database, the RDBMS attribute / column name would become the __key__ component of a graph database property's __key:value__ pair.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- Each __node__ within a graph model can be tagged with one or more __labels__. We apply __labels__ to nodes for purposes of grouping similar nodes together as \"sets\" within our graph database searches. For example, in a graph database comprised of data on movies, we might have nodes representing actors, directors, movie names, movie studios, etc. If so, we could apply appropriate labels to each node, and then use those labels as part of our data retrieval queries. Note that multiple labels could be assigned to any given node, e.g., many actors have also directed films. For an expanded discussion of __labels__, see this link: https://medium.com/neo4j/graph-modeling-labels-71775ff7d121\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- When defining __relationships__, try to craft the different user defined \"types\" of relationships you will instantiate within your graph database such that they are likely to represent common verbs or actions that reflect both the characteristics of the data your are modeling AND the types of queries you are likely to apply to the data. For example, within a graph database comprised of data on movies, we might have __relationships__ such as \"acted in\" or \"directed\". For an expanded discussion of __relationships__, see this link: https://medium.com/neo4j/graph-data-modeling-all-about-relationships-5060e46820ce\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- Each __relationship__ we define between nodes can be of only one user defined relationship \"type\". However, __relationships__ may have one or more __properties__ associated with them.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- When defining __relationships__ it is also useful to consider the \"direction\" or __traversal__ in which your queries are likely to search the graph. For example, contininuing the movie database example, if we wanted to identify all films in which a given actor had appeared, our graph __traversal__ would likely start by locating the node pertaining to the given actor, and then follow and \"acted in\" relationships to access the associated \"movie\" nodes.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- Remember: There is no \"best\" or \"optimal\" way in which to organize any data within a graph database; How we organize our data within a graph database should be dependent on our data retrieval needs, e.g., what sorts of queries do we plan to execute against the data?"
