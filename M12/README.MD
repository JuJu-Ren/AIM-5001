Your task for the Module 12 Assignment is to prepare a collection of text documents for use within a
sentiment analysis algorithm. The data set you will be working with is sourced from this site:
http://www.cs.cornell.edu/people/pabo/movie-review-data/. Specifically, you will be working with the polarity dataset
v2.0, which is comprised of 1000 positive and 1000 negative movie reviews. Each movie review is in the form of freeform text captured from web site postings. To complete this assignment you will need to make use of a fair
amount of pre-processing techniques to prepare the content of the reviews for use within a classification
model (e.g., strip out punctuation, stop words, “tokenize” the data, etc.).
Get started on the Assignment as follows:
1) Download the review_polarity.tar.gz file to your local environment and decompress its contents. The
compressed file contains two directories: neg which contains 1000 negative movie reviews; and pos
which contains 1000 positive movie reviews.
2) Load the neg and pos directories to your AIM 5001 Github Repository. You need to keep the content of
the directories separated since the directories themselves serve as the labels for the classification of
the reviews.
